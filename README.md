## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
List of favorite app: Apple Music, YouTube, Discord and Amazon.
Features I like about those apps: Huge library ( for apple music, youtube and amazon), save prefered items or music (video), easy and secure check out when making in app purchase.
I would like to build an app that will ask the user a series of health-related questions and, based on the answers, provides the
    user with a medical diagnosis based on data from a variety of diseases' symptoms. A good feature to have will be a change of background color depending on the diagnosis. Another feature I would like to implement will be a voice assistant so that user does not have to read the questions and can also answers them by talking to the assistant voice. 
 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The app itself was not complex and did not require advanced knowledge. The only challenge I faced was to do the repository in github since I am new to this. The app was funny to build and I enjoyed it. I can't wait to learn more and try to develop my own iOS app.
